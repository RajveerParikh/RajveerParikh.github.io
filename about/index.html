	<h1>More about me</h1>
	<p>I recently completed my Masters in Computer and Information Technology from The University of Pennsylvania and I just moved to the Bay Area.
	I previously completed my Bachelors in Industrial Engineering from Purdue University in 2012. I started working as an Industrial Engineer after
	graduating and I soon realized that this was not where my interests lay. Knowing this, I went about to discover my calling and exploring my opportunities.</p>
	
	<p>I spent a little over a year working as a Prodcut Manager for a small start up in the tech space which got me intersted in understanding 
	the technologies that were powering these products. I had always had a passion for technologies and had enjoyed my limited experience with 
	software development in the past.</p>
	<p> With this in mind, I decided to pursue my Masters from UPenn. I have spent the last two years building my fundamental knowledge about
	Computer Science focusing on back end technologies and learning about data structures and algorithms. Although I consider Java to be my main 
	language, I am proficient in C, C++ and Python. I have experience with database technologies like MySQL and PostgreSQL as well as NoSQL technologies 
	like MongoDB.</p>
	
	<p> Please reach out to me if you would like to know any more about me. </p>
